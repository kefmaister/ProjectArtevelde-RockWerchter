# Project-Artevelde RockWerchter
Revamped a past Rock Werchter website (Artevelde UAS project) using JavaScript for dynamic features like filtering artist schedules &amp; adding live set previews. Explored Node.js for backend data. A project that rocked my web dev skills!

As a programming student at Artevelde University of Applied Sciences, music came alive for me in a whole new way – through code! My project? Revamping a past website for the legendary Rock Werchter festival. My mission:  breathe new life into it using JavaScript and Node.js, making it a more dynamic and engaging experience for festivalgoers.

**JavaScript Takes Center Stage**

This project was all about diving deeper into the world of JavaScript and Node.js. JavaScript became my tool for adding interactivity to the website. Imagine artist schedules that filter by genre or stage, previews of live sets that get you pumped, or even interactive maps to navigate the festival grounds – all powered by JavaScript's magic!

While JavaScript took the spotlight, Node.js could have played a supporting role behind the scenes. As a backend powerhouse, it could have managed data retrieval and manipulation, ensuring a smooth user experience on the frontend. 

**Rockin' the User Experience**

The project scope depended on the specific Rock Werchter website I chose and my learning goals. Here's what I could have explored:

* **Dynamic Artist Schedule:** Gone were the static schedules!  I could have built a dynamic one using JavaScript, allowing users to filter by genre, day, or stage.  Artist information could come alive with interactive elements like music samples or video previews.
* **Live Festival Buzz:** To capture the electric festival atmosphere online, I could have used JavaScript to integrate features like a live countdown to the event, social media feeds pumping with festival content, or even a real-time weather feed for the festival location.
* **Interactive Navigation:**  JavaScript could have been the key to creating an interactive site map. Users could explore different festival areas, discover stages, food vendors, and other points of interest – all with a few clicks.

**Learning by Doing**

By revamping a real-world website for Rock Werchter, I gained invaluable experience in web development, focusing on JavaScript and Node.js. Here's what I learned:

* **Front-End Prowess with JavaScript:** I honed my skills in using JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web elements, making the website a blast for users to navigate.
* **Backend Exploration with Node.js:** I gained experience in server-side development, understanding how data is managed and delivered to the frontend for a seamless experience.
* **Web Development Rockstar:**  The project allowed me to apply web development best practices, writing clean and maintainable code, ensuring responsiveness across devices, and prioritizing a user experience that would make any festivalgoer mosh with joy.

This project at Artevelde UAS wasn't just about code; it was about combining my passion for music with the thrill of web development. It allowed me to explore the creative potential of JavaScript and Node.js, all while contributing to the online presence of the iconic Rock Werchter festival.
